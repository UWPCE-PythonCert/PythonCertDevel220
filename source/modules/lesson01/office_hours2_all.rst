Mocking
=======

For leeson 6 - Chay Casso - an explanation of what MagicMock actually does, as well as possibly some instruction on how to deal with import statements covering different directories as per the Lesson 6 exercise.

See examples

MagicMock is a subclass of Mock with default implementations of most of the magic methods. You can use MagicMock without having to configure the magic methods yourself.

A mock verifies that the mocked object is called as expected. Useful in unit testing directories

Directories
===========
For lesson 6 - Marc Charbonneau - in video linting. He creates a directory and in the directory there is a file called pycache. He then modifies his imports statements. Would it possible to go over what he did and why.

STOP PRESS
==========
The review / re-introduction to unit testing is probably a good thing -- certainly a number of students hadn't quite "got it" by the end of course 1.

But that left less time than I would have liked to talk about:

parameterized testing
fixtures
mocking.

This may help -- though it's pretty sparse, too.

there is a brief section in there about macking "Input()":

And then you can have your students write 100% test coverage of the mailroom assignment.
